## Reason for this architecture

- some of the options has been fixed by assignment (NestJS + typescript + mysql + graphql), however for the coding part, I separated by resolver and service layer, which I understand it's quite common for NestJS architecture, this will promote other dev to easily read and maintain
- Jest has been used for unit test, it's the most popular one and it's the one that I familiar with, so again, it'll give more productivity for me to complete the assignment within short time and should be easy to maintain also by other dev

## Improvement

- role field in user entity, it should create separate table to save role data and refer as roleId instead.
- it should have audit log to collect who login and calling which api
- role permission should be utitlized and defined permission for each role
- transfer nft should keep record, this can be used to investigate and display history
- logging should return meaningful and severity, this will benefit when investigate
- should containerized and deploy as docker image instead, this will help to run on kubernetes and help with scaling once it's deployed on prod
